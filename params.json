{"name":"Enigma Machine in Python","tagline":"Enigma","body":"# Enigma\r\n\r\n\r\nImplimentation of Enigma machine using python language.\r\n\r\nThis implimentation consists of two rotors, one reflector and one plugboard.\r\n\r\nMore rotors can be added and their wiring can also be changed if required. Default plugboard has ten wires.\r\n\r\nPlain text (unciphered text) can contain all **26 alphabets, spaces, full-stops, quetion-marks, @, -, (, ) and # (but no other characters are allowed)**\r\n\r\nDefault wirings for the two rotors, one reflector and plugboard are:\r\n\r\n | ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ \r\n  --- | --- \r\nrotor no. 1 | DMTWSILRUYQNKFEJCAZBPGXOHV \r\nrotor no. 2 | HQZGPJTMOBLNCIFDYAWVEUSRKX \r\nreflector | EJMZALYXVBWFCRQUONTSPIKHGD \r\nplugboard | BADCFEHGJILKNMPORQTSUVWXYZ \r\n\r\nThe wirings are such that in rotor no. 1 : A maps to D, B maps to M and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n```shell\r\n$ python enigma.py cipher hello world\r\n>>Ciphered text is: xfdwhamzwlbposa\r\n$ python enigma.py decipher xfdwhamqadtn\r\n>>Deciphered text is: hello world\r\n$ python enigma-file.py cipher \"plaint-text-filename.txt\"\r\n$ python enigma-file.py decipher \"encrypted-text-filename.txt\"\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
